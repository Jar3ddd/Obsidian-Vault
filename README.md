This repository is meant to serve as a place to keep updates as well working notes on projects. Please disregard any information not found within a respective folder (i.e., training results and data). I've still have yet to update some information and currently still learning the implementation of Git through Obsidian. Eventually, preliminary results and vault structure will be defined but initial commits have been made (04/18/25).
