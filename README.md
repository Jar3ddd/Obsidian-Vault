This repository is meant to serve as a place to keep updates as well working notes on projects. Please disregard any information not found within a respective folder (i.e., training results and data). I've still yet to update some information and currently still learning the implementation of Git through Obsidian. Eventually, preliminary results and vault structure will be defined but initial commits have been made (04/18/25). Predicted EPM results and summaries of trained models are now found in the Excel sheets directory. Moreover, new subdirectories have been added to include figures, post processing commentary, and commands relevant to analysis or workflow pipeline (05/21/25).
